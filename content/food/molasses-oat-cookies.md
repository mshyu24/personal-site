# Molasses Oat Cookies

A recipe I developed for my fabulous Sbiophysics cohort.
## Ingredients

- 2 sticks softened butter (1 cup)
- 1/2 cup brown sugar
- 1/2 cup molasses
- 1 egg
- 1 tsp baking soda
- 1 tsp salt
- 1 tbsp cinnamon
- 2 tsp ginger
- 1/2 tsp nutmeg
- 1/2 tsp cloves
- 1 1/2 cups flour
- 1 1/2 cups oats


## Instructions

Preheat oven to 375F. Combine butter and sugars in a bowl, beat until creamed. Add eggs and mix. Add baking powder, baking soda, salt, and spices and mix. Gradually add flour and oats. Spoon by rounded tablespoonfuls on to a lined or greased cookie sheet, flatten slightly, and bake for 12 minutes. Remove to wire rack to cool.
