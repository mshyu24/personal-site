# Quick Ratatouille

## Ingredients

- 2 medium zucchini, thinly sliced
- 2 medium yellow squash, thinly sliced
- 1 medium eggplant, thinly sliced into half-disks
- 6 roma tomatoes, thinly sliced
- Italian seasoning
- 1 jar tomato basil pasta sauce
- olive oil

## Instructions

Preheat oven to 400F. Pour jarred sauce in the bottom of a glass pie pan or other baking dish. Arrange sliced vegetables in a pattern, stacking them and laying the stacks on their sides in the pan. Cover with parchment or foil and bake for 45 minutes, or until vegetables are tender. Mix a few tablespoons of olive oil and italian seasoning in a bowl and drizzle over ratatouille. Serve.

We enjoy ratatouille spooned over crusty bread that has been spread with goat cheese.
