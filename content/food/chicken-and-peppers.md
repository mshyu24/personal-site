# Chicken & Peppers Stew

This is a recipe kidnapped and adapted from Tara Parks, my college roommate's mom.

## Ingredients

- 3 chicken breasts
- 1 onion, thinly sliced
- 3-4 bell peppers, any color, thinly sliced
- 1 large can chopped tomatoes
- 1 tbsp chicken-flavored Better than Bouillon
- 2 tsp Hot Shot seasoning blend
- 1 tbsp plus 1 tbsp Montreal Chicken seasoning blend
- 2 tsp onion powder
- 2 tsp garlic powder
- 2 tbsp tomato paste
- 1 tbsp olive oil

## Instructions
Preheat oven to 375F. Season chicken with Montreal Chicken seasoning and bake
until internal temperature reaches 165F. Meanwhile, in a large
pot, heat oil and saute onion and peppers until softened. Add tomatoes,
Better than Bouillon, Hot Shot, onion powder, garlic powder, and tomato paste.
Stir and cook until tomatoes break down and cohesive stew forms, about 15-20
minutes. Shred chicken and add to stew, cook 10 minutes more and serve over rice.
