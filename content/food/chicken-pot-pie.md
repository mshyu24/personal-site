# Chicken Pot Pie

This is my mom's recipe, apparently pulled from a boxed Pillsbury pie crust way back when.

## Ingredients

- 1 double crust recipe for pie crust or refrigerated pie shell
- 1/3 cup butter
- 1/3 cup chopped onion
- 1/2 tsp salt
- 1/4 tsp pepper
- 1/3 cup flour
- 2/3 cup milk
- 3 cups shredded or chopped cooked chicken
- 1 1/2 cup chicken broth
- 2 cups frozen mixed vegetables

## Instructions

Preheat oven to 425F. Line a pie pan with the lower crust. In a medium saucepan, melt butter over medium heat. Add onion, cook until tender. Add flour, salt, and pepper and stir until combined. Gradually stir in broth and milk, stirring and cooking until bubbly and thickened. Add chicken and mixed vegetables, stir until coated. Spoon into pie crust, top with second crust. Seal pie, cutting slits in the top to release steam. Bake 30-40 minutes or until crust is golden brown. Add a foil shield to the edges of the crust halfway through. Let stand 5 minutes and serve.

### Variations
Substitute 3 cups of roasted, cubed sweet potatoes and potatoes (~2 medium potatos and 1 large sweet potato) for the chicken and vegetable broth for the chicken broth for a vegetarian version
