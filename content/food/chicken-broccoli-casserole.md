# Chicken Broccoli Casserole

This is a modified version of my mom's recipe, and one of my favorite comfort foods.

## Ingredients

- 3 large chicken breasts (or ~4 cups of shredded/chopped chicken)
- 3 large heads of broccoli (or 2 small bags of frozen florets)
- 1 large or 2 small cans condensed cream of mushroom soup (14-20oz total)
- 1 cup mayonnaise
- 3/4 cup shredded cheddar cheese (honestly, you can measure this with your heart)
- 1 packet chicken-flavored stuffing mix


## Instructions

Preheat oven to 350F. Cook and slice or shred chicken into bite sized pieces.
Cut and steam broccoli. In a mixing bowl, stir together soup, mayonnaise, and cheese.
Layer chicken, broccoli, and soup mix in a casserole dish. Top with stuffing mix.
Cover with foil and make 30 minutes, remove foil and bake 30 minutes more.
Let sit 10 minutes and serve over rice.
