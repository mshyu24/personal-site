## Instructions

Heat olive oil in a pan over medium heat. Add onions and cook until translucent. Add garlic, tomatoes, and beans, season with salt, pepper, and Italian seasoning. Cook until tomatoes are jammy, smashing some of the beans with a spoon. Add kale, cook until tender.
Meanwhile, toast and butter the bread. Spoon the bean mixture over the toast.
