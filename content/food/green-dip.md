# Green Dip

I created this dip on a whim for some guests and it was an immediate hint. It is particularly great with celery and carrots.

## Ingredients

- Half a bunch fresh cilantro
- 1/3 cup mayonnaise
- 1/4 cup ranch dressing
- Half an avocado
- Couple turns freshly ground pepper
- 1 tbsp onion powder
- 1 tbsp garlic powder
- Juice of half a lime
- Olive oil

## Instructions

Wash and roughly tear cilantro into blender. Add remaining ingredients and
 blend until creamy. If too thick, add olive oil a tablespoon at a time to thin.
 Serve with cut vegetables or pretzels.
