# Stuffed Bell Peppers

A childhood favorite, from my mom's recipe files.

## Ingredients

- 4 medium bell peppers
- 1 lb ground beef or turkey
- 1/2 cup chopped onion
- 2 cloves garlic, minced
- 2 cups cooked rice
- 1 jar tomato pasta sauce
- 8 slices provolone cheese

## Instructions

Preheat oven to 350F. Brown ground meat in saucepan. Add onion and saute until tender. Drain oil and add garlic, saute briefly and add rice and 1/2 jar tomato sauce. Mix well and remove from heat. Remove tops and seeds from peppers and slice in half to form two boats from each pepper. Fill with rice mixture. Place in casserole dish and cover with foil. Bake 45 minutes, uncover and place 1 slice provolone cheese on top of each pepper. Bake 15 minutes more. Enjoy!


### Variations
Substitute a can of white beans and 2 cups of grated zucchini for the ground meat for a tasty vegetarian version.
