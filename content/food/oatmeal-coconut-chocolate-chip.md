# Oatmeal Coconut Chocolate Chip Cookies

A recipe I developed to best incorporate the features I like in cookies.

## Ingredients

- 2 sticks softened butter (1 cup)
- 3/4 cup white sugar
- 3/4 cup brown sugar
- 2 eggs
- 2 tsp vanilla
- 1/4 tsp coconut flavoring
- 2 tsp baking powder
- 1 tsp baking soda
- 1 tsp salt
- 1 1/4 tsp cinnamon
- 2 cups flour
- 1 1/2 cups oats
- 1 cup shredded coconut (sweetened is okay)
- 1 1/2 cups chocolate chips

## Instructions

Preheat oven to 350F. Combine butter and sugars in a bowl, beat until creamed. Add eggs, vanilla, and coconut flavoring and mix. Add baking powder, baking soda, salt, and cinnamon and mix. Gradually add flour and oats. Add coconut and chocolate chips and mix well. Spoon by rounded tablespoonfuls on to a lined or greased cookie sheet, flatten slightly, and bake for 12 minutes. Remove to wire rack to cool.
