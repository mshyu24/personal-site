I am a PhD student in the [Structural Biology](https://med.stanford.edu/structuralbio.html) department at Stanford University. Currently, I am rotating with [Yiorgo Skiniotis's group](https://med.stanford.edu/skiniotislab.html). I am currently serving on the Outreach subcommittee of the [Structural Biology Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion committee](https://med.stanford.edu/structuralbio/diversity-equity-and-inclusion.html).

Before my PhD, I worked as an undergraduate research assistant in the [Tall lab](https://sites.google.com/umich.edu/greg-tall-lab/home) in
 the Department of Pharmacology.
I graduated in May 2021 from the University of Michigan College of Literature, Science, and the Arts, where I majored in biochemistry and pure mathematics, and minored in computer science.
I tutor privately and worked in the [Math Lab](https://lsa.umich.edu/math/undergraduates/course-resources/math-lab.html).
I also served an MWrite Fellow for 3 semesters for Chem 216 with the Sweetland Writing Center and [Prof. Shultz](https://sites.lsa.umich.edu/shultz-lab/).

I spent two years as the Executive Director of the [University of Michigan Science Olympiad](https://umichscioly.org).
UMSO hosts middle and high school students on our campus for
our annual Invitational tournament.
I spent two years on Board as Human Resources before transitioning to the role for the 2019-2020 and 2020-2021 seasons.
I was involved with Science Olympiad in middle school and high school
and I love giving back to the organization that inspired my scientific aspirations whenever possible.
I've served as an Event Supervisor for many tournaments and have more information (including some tests!) on [my page](/miscellanea/science-olympiad).

As of August 2020, I am also a member of the Michigan Science Olympiad Board of
Directors, and as of June 2021, I serve as the Communications Director, managing social media and website for the organization along with supporting collegiate chapters in the state of Michigan.

I also served on leadership with InterVarsity Multi-Ethnic at the University of
 Michigan as the Outreach Coordinator.

 Outside of my assorted University of Michigan affiliations, I am an avid folder of paper -- I helped with the University of Michigan Museum of Art Family Art Studio in June 2020 to guide people through a virtual exploration of origami, and returned for a second session in June 2021!
I am a passionate coffee aficionado and amateur barista -- I am always looking to improve my latte art skills and perfect my Chemex pouring.
I am a frequent baker and dinner party host during non-pandemic
times.
I love creating and I am an amateur photographer, watercolorist, embroiderer, crocheter, and all-around creative dilettante.
