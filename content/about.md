I am a research assistant in the [Tall lab](https://sites.google.com/umich.edu/greg-tall-lab/home) in
 the Department of Pharmacology and an incoming Structural Biology PhD student at Stanford.
I just graduated (class of 2021) from  the University of Michigan College of
Literature, Science, and the Arts, where I majored in biochemistry and pure
mathematics, and minored in computer science. I tutor privately and  worked in
 the [Math Lab](https://lsa.umich.edu/math/undergraduates/course-resources/math-lab.html).
I also served an MWrite Fellow for 3 semesters for Chem 216 with the Sweetland Writing
 Center and [Prof. Shultz](https://sites.lsa.umich.edu/shultz-lab/).

I spent two years as the Executive Director of the [University of Michigan
Science Olympiad](https://umichscioly.org). UMSO hosts middle and high school students on our campus for
our annual Invitational tournament. I spent two years on Board as Human
Resources before transitioning to the role for the 2019-2020 and 2020-2021
seasons. I was involved with Science Olympiad in middle school and high school
and I love giving back to the organization that inspired my scientific aspirations
 whenever possible. I was an Event Supervisor for Water Quality Divisions B&C for the 2019
Region 10 Tournament, and Event Supervisor for Write It Do It Division B for the
 2019 State tournament and planned to supervise for the 2020 tournament before
 its cancellation. In 2021, I supervised Protein Modeling Division C at the Region
 6 Tournament, Write It CAD It Division B at the Regions 11 & 1 joint Tournament,
 Write It CAD It Divisions B & C at the Region 7 Tournament, and Write It CAD It
 Division B at the State Tournament.

As of August 2020, I am also a member of the Michigan Science Olympiad Board of 
Directors.

I also served on leadership with InterVarsity Multi-Ethnic at the University of
 Michigan as the Outreach Coordinator.

 Outside of my assorted University of Michigan affiliations, I am an avid folder
of paper -- I helped with the University of Michigan Museum of Art Family Art
Studio in June 2020 to guide people through a virtual exploration of origami!
I am also a loving bird mother to Chico, my beloved pet Pacific Parrotlet, and
a cat aunt to Pierogi. I am a passionate coffee aficionado and amateur
barista -- I am always looking to improve my latte art skills and perfect my
Chemex pouring. I am a frequent baker and dinner party host during non-pandemic
times. I love creating and I am an amateur photographer, watercolorist,
embroiderer, crocheter, and all-around creative dilettante.
