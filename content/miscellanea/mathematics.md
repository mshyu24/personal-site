# Mathematics

Although I am a pure math major in the U(M) Math Department, I generally prefer to consider myself an amateur mathematician in the original sense of the word -- I do it for the love of the subject.

I have, however, learned some cool things in my time, which I enjoy passing on to people I tutor and anyone else who is willing to listen.

This hexagonal mnemonic is something I learned during my freshman year in Honors Applied Calculus II. I love it as a method to recall trig identities quickly
