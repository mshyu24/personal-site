# Mathematics

Although I am a pure math major in the U(M) Math Department, I generally prefer to consider myself an amateur mathematician in the original sense of the word -- I do it for the love of the subject.

As a pure mathematics major, I've taken (and I am planning to take) some neat coursework:
-- Math 156, honors applied calculus II (F2017)
-- Math 285, honors multivariable calculus (W2018)
-- Math 217, proof-based linear algebra (F2018)
-- Math 465, introduction to combinatorics (and graph theory (W2019)
-- Math 316, differential equations (W2019)
-- Math 412, modern algebra (introduction to ring and group theory) (F2019)
-- Math 451, advanced calculus I (introduction to real analysis)(W2020)
-- Math 490, introduction to topology (F2020)
-- Math 481, introduction to mathematical logic(F2020)
-- Math 475, introduction to number theory (W2021)
-- Math 498, special topics: representation theory of finite and compact groups (W2021)


I have also learned some cool things in my time, which I enjoy passing on to
people I tutor and anyone else who is willing to listen.

This hexagonal mnemonic in particular is something I learned during my freshman
year in Honors Applied Calculus II. I love it as a method to recall trig identities quickly
