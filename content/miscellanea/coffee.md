# Coffee

I am a coffee aficionado and passionate amateur barista. Here are some of my (extremely biased and probably unnecessary) opinions about coffee.

## Roasters
Some of my favorite roasters:

[Counter Culture Coffee](https://counterculturecoffee.com/)

Pretty packaging, fantastic beans, good roasts. I have particularly enjoyed their seasonal blends.

[Madcap Coffee](https://madcapcoffee.com/)

Madcap is based in Grand Rapids, MI, about 45 minutes away from where I grew up. It was one of my first introductions to really excellent coffee, so it has a soft spot in my heart.

[Intelligentsia](https://www.intelligentsiacoffee.com/)

Chicago-based Intelligentsia is a staple of one of my favorite local cafes. They've also partnered with Imperfect Foods to release a whole bean blend that is a staple in my apartment.

[Q.E.D. Coffee](http://www.qedcoffee.com/)

Math. Coffee. What's not to love?

[Tweed Coffee](https://www.tweedcoffee.com/)

I found Tweed Coffee during my summer in Austin, TX, and quickly fell in love.

[The Great Lakes Coffee Roasting Company](https://greatlakescoffee.com/)

My roommate loves decaf coffee -- their House Decaf was a hit!


## Brewing

I am a passionate Chemex user -- I love the application of chemistry, the form, and the minimal bitterness.
However, my bitter-coffee-loving roommate ensures I have other methods on hand -- my setup also includes a conventional pourover cone and an espresso machine for lattes, mochas, cappucinos, and Americanos.
