# Computer Science

My first introduction to computer science came as I was preparing to spend a summer doing [computational research](/research).
I took a free online course in Python through Codeacademy and spent a summer writing short scripts to analyze and visualize data. I was inspired to pursue a more formal education, with the added benefits of following the recommendations of my math advisor. I have since managed to pick up a minor in Computer Science, with coursework in programming fundamentals, data structures, algorithms, and combinatorics. I will finish this in fall 2020 with a course in web systems.

My site is hosted on GitHub. I made it using [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/), an open source static site generator. It uses a modified version of the [Soho theme](https://themes.gohugo.io/soho/).

Though I may eventually make and host small portfolio projects here, most of my current project work has been for courses. Since my site is hosted publicly, those won't be posted here for academic integrity reasons.
