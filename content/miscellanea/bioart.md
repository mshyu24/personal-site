# Bio-Art

I have long enjoyed creating wire sculptures of proteins.

Some past work:
![Zinc Finger Earrings](/images/znf-earrings.jpg)
Zinc Finger earrings (the first protein I made using wire sculpture, and my go-to for testing wire/new scaling). Based off [PDB 1ZNF](https://www.rcsb.org/structure/1ZNF)

![Zinc Finger Necklace](/images/znf-necklace.jpg)
A Zinc Finger necklace. Based off [PDB 1MEY](https://www.rcsb.org/structure/1MEY)

![Zinc Finger Scale test](/images/znf-scale-exp.jpg)
Some zinc fingers I made to test a new copper wire and possible scales. Mechanical pencil eraser and straight pin for size reference.

![Ric-8A pendant](/images/ric-8a-pendant.jpg)
A pendant of a truncation mutation of Ric-8A 1-452.

![G protein alpha pendant](/images/G-alpha-pendant.jpg)
A pendant of a G protein alpha subunit. Based off [PDB 1GIA](https://www.rcsb.org/structure/1GIA).
