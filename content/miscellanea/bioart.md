# Bio-Art

I have long enjoyed creating wire sculptures of proteins. I am currently a part of [CellSpace](https://ccsb.scripps.edu/goodsell/cellspace/), a Bio-Art workshop run by [Dr. David Goodsell](https://ccsb.scripps.edu/goodsell/), where I am working on a project about SARS-CoV-2.

Some past work:
![Zinc Finger Earrings](/images/znf-earrings.jpg)
Zinc Finger earrings (the first protein I made using wire sculpture, and my go-to for testing wire/new scaling). Based off [PDB 1ZNF](https://www.rcsb.org/structure/1ZNF)

![Zinc Finger Necklace](/images/znf-necklace.jpg)
A Zinc Finger necklace. Based off [PDB 1MEY](https://www.rcsb.org/structure/1MEY)

![Zinc Finger Scale test](/images/znf-scale-exp.jpg)
Some zinc fingers I made to test a new copper wire and possible scales. Mechanical pencil eraser and straight pin for size reference.
