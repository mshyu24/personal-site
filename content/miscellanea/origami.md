# Origami

As a seventh grader, I was gifted a Klutz book on origami and an origami-a-day calendar, which set off a fondness for folding paper. While I haven't created any figures or made any particular contributions, I have enjoyed many opportunities to develop and share my skills.

In June 2020, I worked with UMMA to host a Family Art Studio on origami. I assembled a [resource with photo tutorials](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1HyyeMR1eUh1AP1TOf1NWLT5kZtuahc7oA1HvcNisyS0/edit?usp=sharing) on the pieces we made during the session.

I have enjoyed finding fun ways to display simple pieces, usually by hanging them. Some examples:
